#### Update 5/12/2022

Score now works! Sprites are 8x8... for now. Working on an HBlank swap between 8x16 and 8x8 for tall score numbers. It works, but gives some glitches, so it's been left out


#### Launch Status 5/11/2022

All features are present, at least in the back end. Still need to work out getting the score to display on screen, nd other cosmetic fun stuff
